# Nonna on the Go
=========
## A web app project by Alisa Vorotyntseva, Ben Stolb, and Corbin Heryet
Created as a midterm project for Lighthouse Labs, Nonna on the Go is a first attempt from all of us at creating a web app in less than a week. Nonna on the Go is a food ordering service that allows you to order delicious homemade dishes from the local Nonna Maria. Once you login have access to the menu where you can choose what items to add to your cart and then from there you can checkout. Once you submit your order Nonna Maria will receive a text message alerting her to the order and from there she can confirm your order send you back a time estimate through text. 

This project utilised ES6, NodeJS, Express, jQuery, SASS, PostgreSQL, and git.

## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
  - username: `labber` 
  - password: `labber` 
  - database: `midterm`
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Warnings & Tips

- Do not edit the `layout.css` file directly, it is auto-generated by `layout.scss`.
- Split routes into their own resource-based file names, as demonstrated with `users.js` and `widgets.js`.
- Split database schema (table definitions) and seeds (inserts) into separate files, one per table. See `db` folder for pre-populated examples. 
- Use helper functions to run your SQL queries and clean up any data coming back from the database. See `db/queries` for pre-populated examples.
- Use the `npm run db:reset` command each time there is a change to the database schema or seeds. 
  - It runs through each of the files, in order, and executes them against the database. 
  - Note: you will lose all newly created (test) data each time this is run, since the schema files will tend to `DROP` the tables and recreate them.
